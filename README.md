# SpotiFeed4MacrodDroid

A very simple Android [MacroDroid](https://www.macrodroid.com/) macro to subscribe to Open Spotify podcasts with any podcast app. See [references](#references)

# IMPORTANT NOTE
**As Spotifeed has been discontinued, this macro no longer works**!

From the Spotifeed website:
*Unfortunately, Spotify has made critical changes to their podcast download infrastructure that prevents Spotifeed from working.
(...)
For exclusive podcasts, Spotify is using their audio-fa.scdn.co server, which appears to be using a chunked MP4 stream that is not usable by general podcast clients.*
